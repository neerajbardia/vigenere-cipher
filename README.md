# vigenere-cipher
Vigenere cipher is a cryptography technique
The uniqueness of this cipher is the way is its key.
The key is made to match the length of the plaintext, when we enter the key of shorter length the key itself is repeated and the length is matched to that of the plaintext.

# key example
for example: if the plaintext is - encryption
and the key is hello, the resulting key/ the key that will be used will be: hellohel
