# vigenere-cipher
Vigenere cipher is a cryptography technique
The uniqueness of this cipher is the way is its key.
The key is made to match the length of the plaintext, when we enter the key of shorter length the key itself is repeated and the length is matched to that of the plaintext.

# example of key
for example: if the plaintext is - encryption
and the key is hello, the resulting key/ the key that will be used will be: hellohel

# encryption
The encryption process is quite simple, the index of all the letters of the key are mapped to the plaintext, as they both are of the same length there will be a letter of plaintext for every letter of the key. Then the characters are added and the result is rounded off to get the new letter. This is how the encryption process takes place.

# decryption
This process is just the opposite of encryption
